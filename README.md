Project-Ariel
=============

CURRENT PROJECT STATUS: HIATUS as of 2/23/15
This project is currently on hiatus due to my realization that it was secretly a two ton gorilla of a project. Current efforts for this project will be put towards Project-Belle https://github.com/dsilva609/Project-Belle as a proof of concept. When this project does come back from hiatus, there will be a design change from Bang's western theme to a World War II theme. Until then, where is your Love Letter? - D.D.S.

This project is supposed to simulate the card game Bang! It is meant to be an on going project to keep my development skills fresh and up to date. Not sure what this will look like in the end, but it will be a fun and painful jouney.
